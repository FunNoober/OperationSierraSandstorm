## United States Campaign:

**Mission 1 : The Beginning**
A large insurgents base is under assault by the United States. It is the U.S’s job to make sure that base falls. You play as a marine in the first stages of the battle. Your objective is to secure strategic locations in the base with your fellow marines. This camp will provide a forward operating base for the marines in that area.
**Mission 2 : The Insurgents**
The United States’ special forces are cleaning house on an insurgent safe house. They need all the intel they can get and hopefully get the insurgent leader. You play as a Navy S.E.A.L against light insurgent resistance. Little do you or the U.S. know but Russian Spetsnaz are in an undercover operation. This leads to multiple dead Spetsnaz and Russia declaring war on the U.S. You are still successful at getting intel but the insurgent leader was able to escape.
**Mission 3 : Echo 2-1**
A large United States’ convoy is ambushed by a large number of insurgent forces. You play as an army Ranger that was in the convoy and you assist in defending the convoy until additional U.S forces can arrive. The insurgents are equipped with heavy weapons and BMPs. Your team has MAT-Vs and Strykers. After additional reinforcements arrive, you and your team launch a counter attack to a nearby insurgent camp.
**Mission 4 : Invasion**
After the events of the Spetsnaz getting killed at the safe house, Russia is now launching assaults all across United States’ fronts throughout the Middle East. You play as a marine in this mission. Your squad is designated to protect strategic positions across a coastal city from the Russians. The Russians use BTR-82-As and paratroopers to launch their assault. You must hold out for the first stages of the invasion.
**Mission 5 : Stranded**
The United States now has a large problem on their hands. The U.S is now fighting both the insurgents and Russia now. In this mission, you play as a Delta force after your Black Hawk was shot down over Russian airspace. You have to reach a nearby communications outpost to call in the Rangers. The Rangers arrive in their little birds and have a Chinook ready for you.
**Mission 6 : Green Flares**
The United States is launching a huge counter assault on multiple Russian controlled cities throughout the Middle East. In this mission you play as a marine in the front lines. You and your squad have to secure multiple locations in the Middle East city. You secure 1 area and get transported to the next in a Sea Knight. After all primary objectives are secure, you need to pop green flares on the capital building of that city to indicate the city is now under United States control.
**Mission 7 : Sierra Sandstorm**
With the aggression that the United States used, it left many U.S. bases vulnerable to attack. The Russians took advantage of this vulnerability and decided to launch assaults on all the United States bases throughout the Middle East. In this mission you play as a Ranger assisting in evacuation efforts. You have to hold your ground until the embassy staff are evacuated. If you fail (which you will) then Operation Sierra Sandstorm will go into effect.
**Mission 8 : Aftermath**
This is a cutscene of A-10 Warthogs and other heavy aircraft leveling cities and bases all across the Middle East. This is the suicidal victory by the United States. They won, but lost a lot of lives.

Russia, now gaining control over the Middle East, has now decided to launch an all out attack on the continental United States.

Once all the civilians are evacuated, you launch a small counter assault on a Russian strategic position.

Your Black Hawk gets shot down. You are the only one that remain in your squad. You will eventually get overran by Russian infantry.
**Mission 4**
D.C. has fallen to the Russians. The United States fall back to New York. You play as a Delta operator that must provide sniper support to Rangers on the ground. Your position gets overran and you link up with more Delta. You and the Delta launch a counter assault on a Russian FOB.
**Mission 5**
Russia has control over Central Park. You must prevent New York from falling to the Russians so you and your marines launch a counter assault on the FOB in Central Park.
**Mission 6**
The United States has successfully re-taken control over New York. They are now starting a counter assault on the Russian controlled D.C. Helicopters are shot down by the Russians. Eventually you and your squad mates are able to start attacking Russian fortifications. Russia orders a broken arrow. They just nuked every coalition country off the map.

**Mission 2**
You have evaded Russian patrols, your squad needs to meet up with Russian Rebels. These Rebels are on your side because they split off when the United States and Russia started fighting. The rebels have been fighting a civil war. After you make your way to their village, Russian forces begin assaulting the village. You, the rebels, and your squad all have to hold out the assault. After you hold out the assault, more Rebel reinforcements arrive to provide assistance.

After that, you provide sniper support to allow Rebel infantry to enter the city.
**Mission 5**
Rebels have taken the Russian city. This allowed them to increase their firepower due to Russian national guard. This mission takes place after you have taken the city. You have to defend the Russian city from a Russian counter assault. You successful hold the city. Russia is retreating further back into the homeland. You get into some civilian transports and get oscar mike.
**Mission 6**
After the end of last mission, you find your self and your SEAL team at a Russian parking garage. You are now taking out the Russian supply change. The first step is to take out weapon manufacturers, specifically vehicle manufacturers. This place that you are assaulting is in Moscow defended by contractors. You fight your way through the forces in the offices, planting explosives as you go. You make it to the top, you are getting surrounded by local military forces. The only way off this building is parkour. You jump rooftop to rooftop until a Rebel helicopter provides evacuation. You detonate the explosives as you ride out of there. That is the end of that manufacturer.
