<h1>DISCLAIMER: I came up with the concept for the story long before the events currently happening in Europe.</h1>

<h1>Idea #1</h1>
<p>This idea for a story involves the United States and Russia fighting in the Middle East against insurgents when the U.S. leads a raid on a insugent safe house but kills multiple under cover Spetsnaz.</p>
<h2>Act 1</h2> 
<p>Fighting in the Middle East against insurgents and Russia.</p>
<h2>Act 2</h2> 
<p>Russia launches an attack on the United States homeland.</p>
<h2>Act 3</h2> 
<p>Russia nukes half the world but American special forces in Russia re-unite and take down the Russian threat.</p>

<h1>Idea #2</h1>
<p>This idea involves the United States and Russia already at war and Russia developing dangerous chemical weapons in Siberia to use against the Allied forces. Take the chemical facility down.</p>
<h2>Act 1</h2>
<p>Gather intellegence on Russian chemical factory.</p>
<h2>Act 2</h2>
<p>You and other American special forces fight your way to the chemical factory.</p>
<h2>Act 3</h2>
<p>You are seperated from the rest of the squad but Russia is preparing to launch chemical missiles. Fight your way to the command center and stop the firing sequence.</p>
