        <h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>
<p>Sierra Sandstorm is a tactical modern first person shooter game being developed in the Godot game engine. This project is completely free and open source so if you want to, you can contribute to the project directly. Sierra Sandstorm is still in very early alpha with features being added, updated, and removed all the time!</p>
<h2 id="features">Features</h2>
<h3 id="tactical-features">Tactical Features</h3>
<p>As mentioned previously, Sierra Sandstorm is a tactical first person shooter. I feel calling it tactical is a little to generous though. There are basic features such as leaning, crouching, and aiming down your sights, but I wish to add many more features in the future that would make this a truly free tactical experience.</p>
<h3 id="gameplay-features">Gameplay Features</h3>
<p>A lot of the tactical and gameplay features overlap. So I will skip the ones mentioned previously. There are various gameplay features such as, vehicles, enemies, friendlies, reloading, and much more to come in the future!</p>
<h2 id="assets">Assets</h2>
<h3 id="assets-and-other-3rd-party-items-used">Assets And Other 3rd Party Items Used</h3>
<p>I, Fun Noober, do not like using assets in development. I prefer to do everything from scratch in my game engine. I feel this makes gameplay more genuine and unique compared to something like an asset flip. No assets are used in development.</p>
<p>There are many 3rd party items however. I often use external fonts for the user interface. I may also use a color pallet to get that user interface looking just a little bit more polished.</p>
<h3 id="code-license">Code License</h3>
<p>All the code in this project is licensed under the MIT license. This license is a permissive license meaning you are granted permission to use the code unlike something like a GPL that is 'copy-right' and you do not even need permission. I went with the MIT license because it strikes a good middle ground between open-source and proprietary. This means the project is 'legally' open source but users are allowed to use the code in their own proprietary projects.</p>
<h2 id="information-about-the-lore">Information About the Lore</h2>
<p>Please keep in mind I wrote the lore before the Eastern-European events.</p>
<h3 id="pre-war">Pre-War</h3>
<p>Sierra Sandstorm takes place in a near future world were tensions between the United States and Russia are still high from the Cold War. All it takes is the wrong move from either nation to start war. Well this did happen. In the Middle East, both Russia and the United States forces were fighting insurgents. One day, Navy SEALs were deployed to lead a raid on an insurgent safe house. What they did not know is that undercover Spetsnaz were also there. The SEALs ended up killing the Russian Special Forces. Russia did not like this and declared war on the United States and related NATO forces.</p>
<h3 id="during-the-war">During the War</h3>
<p>There is various fighting at multiple bases and cities in the Middle East between Russia and the United States. One day, under the direct orders of the top brass of the United States, the forces lead an all out assault on Russian facilities. This left the U.S. bases undefended. Russia struck the bases causing the United States to lose a foothold in the Middle East.</p>
<p>Russia, now gaining an advantage over the United States, decide to lead an assault on the United States homeland. Russia starts conquering United States fortifications until they reached New York. The forces of the United States were able to slow down the Russians but the Russians had overwhelming firepower. When Russia took New York, a joint special forces operation led an assault on the Russian base there. This allowed the United States to set up a beach head and start funneling in troops from the West over to the East. When the Russian fortifications were destroyed, the troops in the area requested a broken arrow. The Russian top brass took this a step further and decided to nuke every NATO country off the map.</p>
