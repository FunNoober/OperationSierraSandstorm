<h2>What Is This?</h2>
<p>Operation Sierra Sandstorm is a first person shooter game set in the not so distant future. In this timeline, tensions between
    the United States and Russia are still high from the Cold War. Both the United States and Russia are stationed in the Middle East
    fighting insurgents. The United States is sending Navy SEALs on a operation to get intel from the insurgents. They do not know that
    Russian Spetsnaz are under cover though. This leads to the death of those Russians and the start of World War 3.
